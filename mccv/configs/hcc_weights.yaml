# MCCV HCC Weights Configuration
# These weights define how much each treatment modality contributes to the
# coherence score for each HCC code.
#
# Weights are derived from clinical practice guidelines and reflect the
# relative importance of each type of treatment evidence.
#
# Scale: 0.0 (not expected) to 1.0 (critical/mandatory)
